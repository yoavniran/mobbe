## My Own BackBone Extension

This project is a side-product from my MSc dissertation.
It isn't maintained or used currently anywhere else.

Its inspired by [Backbone.Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) (around its 1.x era). 

The goal is to extend the basic functionality of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and therefore is dependent on Backbone as well as on [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)/[Lodash](https://lodash.com/), [jQuery](https://lodash.com/), [Backbone.Wreqr](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr) and [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).
	
These are the classes provided in this library:

### Application

### View

### MultiItemView

### Panel

### MasterPanel

### Overlay

### Controller

### RouteController
